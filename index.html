            <p>The very first jigsaw puzzle is said to have been made by London mapmaker John Spilsbury in the 1760s. "He pasted a map onto a thin piece of wood, and he used a scroll saw to cut it up; England would be one piece, Germany would be another piece," said Anne Williams, a jigsaw puzzle historian and author of "The Jigsaw Puzzle: Piecing Together a History."</p>
            <p>"He marketed these to the very affluent and influential people as a tool to teach their children geography." "Anne, I gotta say, a jigsaw puzzle's a great way to learn geography," said Rocca.
            "Absolutely," she replied. "I think just about everybody spent some time in their childhood putting a map of the United States together."</p>
